# TestGlass: A simple MQTT project


## Opening and compiling the app

1. You will need a recent copy of RAD Studio or Delphi. You can download a trial or the free CE version here: [www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

2. You will also need to install the TMS MQTT component. Go to [www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmsmqtt.asp](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmsmqtt.asp) The code will work with the trial version.

## Where can I see the app in action?
I wrote this for an episode of our Embarcadero 30 for 30 webinar series.  You can catch the webinar replay via the link below.

The video shows the app in use and explains how I did it.

## What other thing does the app do?
I included a few little tricks like a semi-transparent 'glass' effect, a draggable captionless form which remembers the last position it started, and a shrink/unshrink capability just to show off a few capabilities of RAD Studio FireMonkey FMX.

## Important notes
In the video I connect to an M5Atom device from M5 Stack (see the video for more details). It is broadcasting MQTT packets to the M5Stack MQTT broker: mqtt.m5stack.com
